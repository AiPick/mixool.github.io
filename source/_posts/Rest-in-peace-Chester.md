#### Numb
**I'm tired of being what you want me to be**
~~我厌倦了当你的傀儡~~
**Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface**
~~感到茫然无主，在表象之下迷失了自我~~
**Don't know what you're expecting of me**
~~不知道你究竟对我有何种期望~~
**Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes**
~~活在你的阴影下饱受压力~~
**(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)**
~~（泥足深陷，无法自拔）~~
**Every step I take is another mistake to you**
~~我所走的每一步对你而言不过是另一個错误~~
**(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)**
~~（泥足深陷，无法自拔）~~

**I've become so numb, I can't feel you there**
~~我已麻木，感觉不到你的存在~~
**I've become so tired, so much more aware**
~~我已精疲力尽，卻更加觉醒了悟~~
**I'm becoming this, all I want to do**
~~我逐渐明白，我一心渴望的~~
**Is be more like me and be less like you**
~~就是活得更像自己，而非另一个你~~

**Can't you see that you're smothering me**
~~你难道沒发现你快让我窒息了吗~~
**Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control**
~~死命紧抓不放，害怕失去掌控~~
**Cause everything that you thought I would be**
~~因为你对我的种种期待~~
**Has fallen apart right in front of you**
~~已全然在你面前支离破碎~~
**(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)**
~~（泥足深陷，無法自拔）~~
**Every step that I take is another mistake to you**
~~我所走的每一步对你而言不过是另一个错误~~
**(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)**
~~（泥足深陷，無法自拔）~~
**And every second I waste is more than I can take**
~~而我不会再这样浪费我的一分一秒~~

**I've become so numb, I can't feel you there**
~~我已麻木，感覺不到你的存在~~
**I've become so tired, so much more aware**
~~我已精疲力尽，卻更加觉醒了悟~~
**I'm becoming this, all I want to do**
~~我逐渐明白，我一心渴望的~~
**Is be more like me and be less like you**
~~就是活得更像自己，而非另一個你~~
**And I know I may end up failing too**
~~我明白我最后可能也会一败涂地~~
**But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you**
~~但我知道你正如同我一样，也曾有人对你失望至极~~
